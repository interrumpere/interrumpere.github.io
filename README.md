# Learning about R
Right now this acts as a repository of R projects I've worked on. So far, I know very little, but practice makes perfect!

**Week One:**  

This week I did some work on property crime in Taipei City using the five major verbs in Dpylr. The dataset I worked with contained information about burgulary, car theft, and bike theft from 2015-2018. [Week One page](https://interrumpere.github.io/19.03.2019/Dplyr_Verbs.html)

**Final Project:**

The result of quite a bit of work, a script which checks a user-provided document against a corpus of words from 4chan, as an attempt to gauge similarity between the documents. Further write-up [here](https://interrumpere.github.io/Document%20Checker/doc_final.html).
